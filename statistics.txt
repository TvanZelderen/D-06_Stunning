#ideas: 
# 1) chi-square test (statistical hypothesis test used in the analysis of contingency tables when the sample sizes are large. In simpler terms, this test is primarily used to examine whether two categorical variables are independent in influencing the test statistic.)
# 2) for each stage take X random points, calculate standard deviation of each (compare how a stage for a weld compares to a "reference" graph) |We don't get a reference file, Frank|
# 3) set up a matrix to find coefficients (like ANA), set up polynomial and compare coefficients for different welds



Possible thngs to find out
1. Find the number of peaks in the pressure graphs
2. Find the spacing between peaks in the pressure graphs
3. Find out if there if the values are somewhere diecreasing in the displacment graph
4. Find out if there is a (near)-zero value in the mdidle of the power graph
5. Find The different welding stages for the power graph (Ber, Mig, Zoe, Wei, Luuk)
6. Find the outliers in the power graph (Zoli, Ries)
