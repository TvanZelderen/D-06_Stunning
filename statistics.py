#ideas: 
# 1) chi-square test (statistical hypothesis test used in the analysis of contingency tables when the sample sizes are large. In simpler terms, this test is primarily used to examine whether two categorical variables are independent in influencing the test statistic.)
# 2) for each stage take X random points, calculate standard deviation of each (compare how a stage for a weld compares to a "reference" graph) |We don't get a reference file, Frank|
# 3) set up a matrix to find coefficients (like ANA), set up polynomial and compare coefficients for different welds
